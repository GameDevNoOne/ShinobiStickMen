# **The Sword-fighting game** (*Name Pending*)

## **A 1-hit Combat Game**

This game is meant for a general practice of Animations, Enemy design and combat.
The game is single-player, maybe at one point even a multiplayer game but I'd have to look into it.

The point of the game is more of a boss rush. You, a shinobi, has been tasked with killing traitors of the clan by your master. You will proceed to fight other shinobi with similiar skills as you but you and your enemy can die in a single hit. So how do you prevent that? **Parrying**. The game's combat is to focus on the parrying.
Both you and the enemy can parry the other one. The challenge is to hit at the exact moment for the attack to connect after the parry.
The game will have multiple weapons with variations in functionality.
The plan is for 3 weapons:
- A Katana - a middle ground between a Greatsword and a Rapier,
- A Greatsword(Gut's Greatsword in design) - A slow attack but a large parry window and a long parry stun,
- A Rapier - A quick attack but a small parry window and a short parry stun
No it's not historically accurate but I kind of don't care.

That's it for now.
